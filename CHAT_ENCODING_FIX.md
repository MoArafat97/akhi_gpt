# Chat Response Encoding Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing strange block characters (‚ñà) appearing throughout chat responses, causing formatting errors and making text difficult to read. This was particularly problematic for:
- Arabic text and Islamic phrases
- Emojis and special characters
- Any non-ASCII content

## Root Cause
The issue was in `lib/services/openrouter_service.dart` at line 270:

```dart
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
final chunkStr = String.fromCharCodes(chunk);
```

This method (`String.fromCharCodes`) treats each byte as a separate character code, which breaks UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 characters can span multiple bytes, so this approach corrupted multi-byte characters, resulting in the block characters (‚ñà) appearing in place of properly encoded text.

## Solution
Replaced the problematic line with proper UTF-8 decoding:

```dart
// FIXED CODE:
final chunkStr = utf8.decode(chunk, allowMalformed: true);
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Proper UTF-8 Decoding**: `utf8.decode()` correctly handles multi-byte UTF-8 sequences
2. **Graceful Error Handling**: `allowMalformed: true` ensures the app doesn't crash on invalid bytes
3. **Preserves All Characters**: Arabic text, emojis, and special characters are now displayed correctly

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/openrouter_service.dart` - Fixed UTF-8 decoding in streaming response handler

## Testing
Created comprehensive UTF-8 encoding tests in `test/utf8_encoding_test.dart` that verify:
- ‚úÖ Arabic characters display correctly
- ‚úÖ Emojis render properly  
- ‚úÖ Common Islamic phrases work
- ‚úÖ Malformed UTF-8 is handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ No block characters (‚ñà) appear

## Impact
This fix resolves:
- ‚ùå Block characters in chat responses
- ‚ùå Corrupted Arabic text
- ‚ùå Broken emojis
- ‚ùå Formatting errors in streaming responses

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
Bro, I hear you, and it's completely natural to 
feel this way when you're pouring your heart 
and soul into something and it doesn't turn 
out the way you hoped. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

But let‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàs think about this for a moment.
Did you pray because you wanted your book 
to be popular on Royal Road, or because you 
wanted to create something meaningful and 
share your story with those who needed to 
hear it? Sometimes, what we ask for is not 
what we truly need, or not what‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàs best 
for us. Allah knows what‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàs truly good for 
us, even if it doesn‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàt look like what we 
imagined.
```

### After (Fixed):

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Dart/Flutter
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Stream Processing**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) from OpenRouter API
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with `allowMalformed: true`

The fix ensures that all text content, regardless of language or character set, displays correctly in the Akhi GPT chat interface.
